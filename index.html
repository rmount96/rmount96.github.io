        <p>Coincidence that my last name is Mount and I love to climb mountains?</p>

        <p>My dad and I started climbing on a whim after we read a book about Long's Peak in Colorado when we were staying in Estes Park. We knew that we wouldn't be able to tackle the highest mountain in the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm">RMNP</a> without a little (or a lot) of experience so we trekked Mount Lady Washington, Longs' neighbor and got an incredible view of the mountains flat face, known as the diamond. It would take us two more years before we summited Long's. Due to being flatlanders and my dad being 62 at the time, it took us every bit of 19 hours for the most rewarding and beautiful experience of our lives.</p>
